# countermvvm

A simple Android app built with Kotlin using **Jetpack Compose** and the **MVVM architecture pattern**. The app displays a counter that can be increased or decreased using two buttons.

## Tech Stack

* Kotlin
* Jetpack Compose
* MVVM Architecture
* Android ViewModel

## How It Works

1. The app displays a counter value in the center of the screen.
2. There are two buttons: `Increment` and `Decrement`.
3. Pressing either button will increase or decrease the count.
4. The count value updates automatically using `mutableStateOf` from Jetpack Compose and is managed by a `ViewModel`.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and open it in Android Studio.
2. Run the app on an emulator or physical Android device.
3. Press the `Increment` button to increase the count.
4. Press the `Decrement` button to decrease the count.
